// Single page application since only two pages
//   2   - May change if decide to add a login system
//   3 
//   4 Get the structure of the data returned by the api before writing any components
//   5 to handle it
//   6 
//   7 If single page app is it possible to go back to the same page once the page
//   8 refreshes ? i.e. store in localStorage what page you were on ? This would be
//   9 cool.
//  10 
//  11 Single page application means that api call does not have to be remade
//  12 everytime switching between pages. At least this is my aim.
//  13 
//  14 See if possible to cache api data when offline.

//  16 SPA has a cross-site scripting (XSS) and allows attackers to inject client-side
//  17 scripts into the web application.a - check how to overcome this.
//  18 
//  19 Slow: While the user experience of SPAs on runtime is fast, it is slower to
//  20 download and can also be slowed down if there are memory leaks in JavaScript.
//  21 It is hence not suitable for very large applications with a lot of data. - make
//  22 sure there are no memory leaks.
//  23 
//  24 Can mention other advantages and disadvantages for SPA possibly.
//  25 
//  26 Will use BrowserRouter instead of HashRouter - probably explain why.
//  27 
//  28 make sure with SPA that users can:
//  29 The URL displayed in the address bar always reflects the thing that they are viewing.
//  30 They can use the browser's back and forward buttons...successfully.
//  31 They can navigate to a particular view (aka deep link) directly using the appropriate URL.
//  32 
//  33 Make sure to do the html title!!
//  34 
//  35 Add some spinners for loading
//  36
